<h1>Shuriken Beat Slicer</h1>

<p>Shuriken is an open source beat slicer which harnesses the power of
aubio's onset detection algorithms and Rubber Band's time stretching
capabilities.&nbsp; A simple Qt4 interface makes it easy to slice up
drum loops, assign individual drum hits to MIDI keys, and change the
tempo of loops in real-time.&nbsp; The JUCE library takes care of handling 
audio and MIDI behind the scenes.</p>

<h1><a name="Importing_Audio_Files"></a>Importing Audio Files</h1>

<p>To get started with Shuriken, first import an audio file.&nbsp; Audio samples are loaded
into RAM before editing so the original files always remain untouched.</p>

<p>Shuriken calls on the abilities of libsndfile when importing audio files.&nbsp;
For full details of supported file formats please see: <a href="http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features">http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features</a></p>

<p>Shuriken also comes with sndlib statically built in.&nbsp; sndlib can read the
following file formats:</p>

<p><ul>
<li>NeXT/Sun/DEC/Afsp</li>

<h1><a name="Slice_n_Dice"></a>Slice 'n' Dice</h1>

<p>Once an audio file has been imported, its waveform is displayed in the
main window.&nbsp; Selecting &#8220;Onsets&#8221; and clicking &#8220;Find&#8221; will place a slice point
at the start of every drum hit or note.&nbsp; Selecting &#8220;Beats&#8221; and clicking &#8220;Find&#8221; 
will insert a slice point at the beginning of every beat of the bar.</p>

<p>When searching for onsets or beats, you have the option to automatically adjust the position of each slice 
point by moving it to the closest, next, or previous zero-crossing.&nbsp; These options can be selected from the 
&#8220;Zero-X&#8221; drop-down list.&nbsp; The default setting is to ignore zero-crossings.</p>

<p>To add additional slice points, hover the mouse over the
waveform and press the Insert key on the keyboard.&nbsp; To delete a
slice point, select it and press Delete.</p> 

<p>Though aubio does a good job of detecting onsets, you'll still probably want to adjust the
position of the slice points manually before clicking &#8220;Slice&#8221;.&nbsp;
Right-clicking on a slice point will reveal a context menu which allows you to move the slice point 
to the next or previous zero-crossing.&nbsp; Clicking on the waveform between slice points will allow you to
audition each section of audio before slicing.</p>

<p>Once the waveform has been sliced, each audio slice is automatically
assigned to a separate MIDI key starting from middle C (C4) and
ascending chromatically.&nbsp; You can drag an audio slice left or
right to assign it to a different key.&nbsp; Slices can be reordered
then joined together by toggling the &#8220;Slice&#8221; button.&nbsp; To select
multiple slices, click &#8220;Multi Select&#8221; on the toolbar then drag the mouse over
the waveform.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="Detection_Options"></a>Detection Options</h1>

<p>&#8220;Detection Method&#8221;, &#8220;Window Size&#8221;, &#8220;Hop Size&#8221;, and &#8220;Threshold&#8221; affect
the accuracy of aubio's onset and beat detection routines.&nbsp; The default settings should
give good results in many, though not all, situations.&nbsp;
Experimenting with the settings may produce better results in some
instances.</p>

<br>

<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Detection Method</dt>
  <dd>Various scientific methods have been devised for
detecting onsets.&nbsp; For more info on each of these methods please
see: <a href="http://aubio.org/doc/0.4.1/specdesc_8h.html#details">http://aubio.org/doc/0.4.1/specdesc_8h.html#details</a>
and <a href="http://dev.aubio.org/wiki/Publications">http://dev.aubio.org/wiki/Publications</a></dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Window Size</dt>
  <dd>aubio works by analysing audio in chunks.&nbsp; Here you can set
how many samples should be processed at a time.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Hop Size</dt>
  <dd>Each window of samples to be analysed can partly overlap the
previously analysed window.&nbsp; If, for example, &#8220;Window Size&#8221; is set
to 1024 and &#8220;Hop Size&#8221; is set to 25%, then the next window of samples
will be 256 samples along from the start of the previous window.&nbsp;
This overlap can help to produce better results.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Threshold</dt>
  <dd>This determines the sensitivity of the detection
routine.&nbsp; Lowering the threshold will result in more detections,
raising it will result in fewer.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="Calculating_BPM"></a>Calculating BPM</h1>

<p>The &#8220;Time Signature&#8221; and &#8220;Length&#8221; widgets
allow you to specify the length of an audio loop in bars or beats.&nbsp; Shuriken 
then does the appropriate maths to calculate the BPM once the &#8220;Calc&#8221; button is clicked.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="Time_Stretching"></a>Time Stretching</h1>

<p>The Rubber Band library takes care of time stretching duties within
Shuriken and provides two modes of operation: offline and real-time.&nbsp; To switch between 
offline and real-time mode, open the options dialogue and click the appropriate radio button 
under the &#8220;Time Stretch&#8221; tab.</p>

<p>Hint: if you find that JACK's DSP load is too high when time stretching in
real-time mode, try setting &#8220;Window Size&#8221; to &#8220;Short&#8221;.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="Global_Time_Stretch"></a>Global Time Stretch</h2>

<p>Global time stretching allows you to stretch/squeeze the entire audio loop.</p>

<p>In offline mode, first click the &#8220;Calc&#8221; button (or manually enter the
current BPM in the &#8220;Original BPM&#8221; box) then enter the desired BPM in
the &#8220;New BPM&#8221; box and click &#8220;Apply&#8221;.</p>

<p>In real-time mode, enter values into the &#8220;Original BPM&#8221; and &#8220;New BPM&#8221;
boxes as before, but now the tempo of the audio can be changed on the
fly.&nbsp; Try clicking the up and down arrows on the &#8220;New BPM&#8221; box.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="Selective_Time_Stretch"></a>Selective Time Stretch</h2>

<p>Selective time stretching allows you to stretch/squeeze individual audio slices.&nbsp; You 
must be in real-time mode and the waveform must be sliced 
before the &#8220;Selective Time Stretch&#8221; button is enabled.&nbsp; Toggling this button will display 
markers between each audio slice.&nbsp; Simply drag a marker to stretch/squeeze the audio either 
side of it.&nbsp; Markers can be snapped to beats or divisions of a beat by selecting the 
desired setting from the &#8220;Snap&#8221; combo box (BPM must be set first).&nbsp; Toggle the &#8220;Selective 
Time Stretch&#8221; button again to leave this mode.</p>

<p>Note that un-slicing the waveform or switching to offline mode after working in selective time 
stretch mode causes any stretches to be rendered offline.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="Stretch_Options"></a>Stretch Options</h2>

<p>Options to fine-tune Rubber Band's operation are available as follows (taken from the Rubber Band documentation):</p>

<h3>Stretch Profile</h3>

Control the profile used for variable time
stretching.&nbsp; Rubber Band always adjusts the stretch profile to
minimise stretching of busy broadband transient sounds, but the degree
to which it does so is adjustable.

<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Elastic</dt>
  <dd>The audio will be stretched at a variable rate, aimed at
preserving the quality of transient sounds as much as possible.&nbsp;
The timings of low activity regions between transients may be less
exact than when the &#8220;Precise&#8221; profile is set.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Precise</dt>
  <dd>Although still using a variable stretch rate, the audio will
be stretched so as to maintain as close as possible to a linear stretch
ratio throughout.&nbsp; Timing may be better than when using &#8220;Elastic&#8221;,
at slight cost to the sound quality of transients.&nbsp; This setting
is always used when running in real-time mode.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h3>Transients</h3>

Control the component frequency phase-reset mechanism that
may be used at transient points to provide clarity and realism to
percussion and other significant transient sounds.

<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Crisp</dt>
  <dd>Reset component phases at the peak of each transient (the start
of a significant note or percussive event).&nbsp; This, the default
setting, usually results in a clear-sounding output; but it is not
always consistent, and may cause interruptions in stable sounds present
at the same time as transient events.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Mixed</dt>
  <dd>Reset component phases at the peak of each transient, outside a
frequency range typical of musical fundamental frequencies.&nbsp; The
results may be more regular for mixed stable and percussive notes than
&#8220;Crisp&#8221;, but with a phasier sound.&nbsp; The balance may sound very
good for certain types of music and fairly bad for others.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">Smooth</dt>
  <dd>Do not reset component phases at any point.&nbsp; The results
will be smoother and more regular but may be less clear than with
either of the other transients options.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h3>Phase</h3>

Control the adjustment of component frequency phases from one
analysis window to the next during non-transient segments.

<dl>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Laminar</span></dt>
  <dd>Adjust phases when stretching in such a way as to try to
retain the continuity of phase relationships between adjacent frequency
bins whose phases are behaving in similar ways.&nbsp; This, the default
setting, should give good results in most situations.</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Independent</span></dt>
  <dd>Adjust the phase in each frequency bin independently from
its neighbours.&nbsp; This usually results in a slightly softer,
phasier sound.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h3>Window Size</h3>

Control the window size for FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
processing.&nbsp; The window size actually used will depend on many
factors, but it can be influenced.

<dl>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard</span></dt>
  <dd>Use the default window size. The actual size will vary
depending on other parameters. This option is expected to produce
better results than the other window options in most situations.</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Short</span></dt>
  <dd>Use a shorter window.&nbsp; This may result in crisper sound for
audio that depends strongly on its timing qualities.&nbsp; Also has the
effect of reducing
JACK's DSP load when running in real-time mode.</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Long</span></dt>
  <dd>Use a longer window.&nbsp; This is likely to result in a smoother
sound at the expense of clarity and timing.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h3>Formant</h3>

Control the handling of formant shape (spectral envelope) when
pitch-shifting.&nbsp; Only effective when pitch correction is turned off.

<dl>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shifted</span></dt>
  <dd>Apply no special formant processing.&nbsp; The spectral envelope
will be pitch shifted as normal.</dd>
  <dt><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preserved</span></dt>
  <dd>Preserve the spectral envelope of the unshifted
signal.&nbsp; This permits shifting the note frequency without so
substantially affecting the perceived pitch profile of the voice or
instrument.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h3>Pitch Shifting</h3>

Control the method used for pitch shifting (only effective when pitch 
correction is turned off).&nbsp; These
options may be changed at any time. They are only effective in
real-time mode; in offline mode, the pitch-shift method is fixed.

<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">High Speed</dt>
  <dd>Use a method with a CPU cost that is relatively moderate
and predictable.&nbsp; This may sound less clear than &#8220;High Quality&#8221;,
especially for large pitch shifts. </dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">High Quality</dt>
  <dd>Use the highest quality method for pitch shifting.&nbsp;
This method has a CPU cost approximately proportional to the required
frequency shift.</dd>
  <dt style="font-weight: bold;">High Consistency</dt>
  <dd>Use the method that gives greatest consistency when used
to create small variations in pitch around the 1.0-ratio level.&nbsp;
Unlike the previous two options, this avoids discontinuities when
moving across the 1.0 pitch scale in real-time; it also consumes more
CPU than the others in the case where the pitch scale is exactly 1.0.</dd>
</dl>

<br>

<h2><a name="JACK_Sync"></a>JACK Sync</h2>

<p>If &#8220;Audio Back-end&#8221; has been set to JACK (under the &#8220;Audio Setup&#8221; tab)
then the &#8220;JACK Sync&#8221; option will also be made available.&nbsp; Use this
option to synchronise the BPM of the audio with tempo changes in a
sequencer.&nbsp; For this to work, you need to ensure that the
sequencer is actually sending tempo change information via JACK (e.g.
in Ardour 3 click the &#8220;external positional sync&#8221; button to change its
text from &#8220;Internal&#8221; to &#8220;JACK&#8221;).&nbsp; &#8220;Original BPM&#8221; has to be fairly
accurate for this to work well, so you may need to adjust it manually.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="JACK_Outputs"></a>JACK Outputs</h1>

<p>The JACK Outputs dialogue becomes available when &#8220;JACK&#8221; is selected as the audio back-end.&nbsp; The 
dialogue displays a grid which allows you to route any audio slice to any of Shuriken's outputs.&nbsp; The 
number of outputs can be increased up to a maximum of 16 stereo outputs.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="Export_Options"></a>Export Options</h1>

<p>Shuriken allows audio slices to be exported as individual audio files in WAV, AIFF, AU, 
FLAC or Ogg format, with options for encoding (e.g. 16-bit PCM) and sample rate.&nbsp; There are 
also options for exporting a Hydrogen drumkit, SFZ, or Akai .pgm file.&nbsp; A standard MIDI file 
may be exported either on its own or along with the audio files.&nbsp; When exporting a MIDI file, 
you will be asked to confirm the BPM and time signature in case one or the other has not yet 
been set in the main window.&nbsp; Note that MIDI files store tempo in terms of quarter notes 
rather than beats per minute, so a drum loop at 140 BPM where the beat is an eighth note 
would have a tempo of 70 quarter notes per minute.</p>
<p><br></p>


<h1><a name="Session_Management"></a>Session Management</h1>

<p>Shuriken has full support for Non Session Management.&nbsp; It is possible to import an existing project
into a NSM session as well as export a project from a session.</p>

<p>Shuriken also has support for LADISH L1 session management.&nbsp; On receiving the SIGUSR1 Unix signal, 
Shuriken will save the current project.&nbsp; On receiving the SIGTERM signal, Shuriken will ask 
the user if any unsaved changes should be saved, then exit cleanly.&nbsp; Shuriken can deal with 
these signals being sent in quick succession and in any order; any save operation will 
complete before the application shuts down.</p>

<p>To allow LADISH to open a saved project, the file path of the project can be given as an argument when 
starting Shuriken from the command line, e.g.:</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 40px;">shuriken '/home/user/project.shuriken'</p>

<p>When using Shuriken in a LADISH session, make sure &#8220;Audio Back-end&#8221; is set to JACK 
in the Options dialogue otherwise Shuriken will terminate when you try to save the session!</p>
